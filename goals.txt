My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year
My primary goal for the next year is centered on achieving success that truly matters to me: making my parents proud through my academic achievements. Their support means everything, and I aim to show them the value of their investment in my education by working diligently and realizing my full potential. This involves not only getting excellent grades but also developing critical skills that will benefit my future career.

Academically, my most significant objective is to gain acceptance into a top-tier university that offers my dream major. To achieve this, I am dedicating myself to mastering the subjects I am currently studying at FST and building a strong, compelling application. I plan to focus on enhancing my programming knowledge or participating in researchto ensure I am well-prepared and stand out when pursuing my ideal educational path.
